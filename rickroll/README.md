# Rickroll
A basic Rickroll module that disables sudo and doas, plays Never Gonna Give You Up in ASCII and makes logging in as root impossible for 60 seconds. Restores sudo and doas after being rmmoded.

# Build
To build the module, run `make`. This will download the video through youtube-dl, move it and compile the module. If you already have the video installed, run `make novid`.
