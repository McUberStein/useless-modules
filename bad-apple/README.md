# Bad Apple
A simple kernel module that plays Bad Apple in ASCII art through MPV and redirects the output to `/dev/pts/1`. Requires pip and mpv. The resolution might be off.

# Build
To make the module and download Bad Apple, run `make`. If the video is already downloaded and you simply want to make the module, run `make novid`.
